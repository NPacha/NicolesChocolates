# Final Projects

## Schedule

**Saturday, March 20th through Saturday, April 10th Final Project***
** Saturday April 10th through Wednesday, April 14th Portfolio***

There are no full day classes during project weeks, but we do expect you to be working on your project daily and be available during the usual class times (10AM - 6PM Eastern).

- During these weeks, there is no required attendance outside of
- **Outcomes**  Unless otherwise announced.
- ** 30 Minute Checkins Tuesdays, Wed, and Thursday **
- Your Pushed Commits to your repo are your attendance, you have to push to your repo at minimum on every class day, and we suggest daily

*Failure to make an attendance check will result in an unexcused absence for both morning and afternoon for that day. Failure to respond to instructors in reasonable time, when contacted during normal class hours can result in an absence for both the morning and afternoon of that day*

## Outline

During your final weeks, you will be building two projects. One will be a Portfolio site and the other will be your most ambitious and exciting project for this course!

Before you begin, note that this will be your pièce de résistance. These will be the sites that you show off to employers, so really throw yourself into it.

## Requirements

### 1. Portfolio Site

Finish a site that shows off your work



### 2. Final Project

Your final project should be an app that

- Has an idea and technical stack (including database and server) that will be approved by the instructional team before you begin
- Is hosted somewhere on the internet
- Demonstrates your ability to teach yourself something new!

## Technical Requirements (Final Project)
### &#x1F534; Mandatory to pass:
#### MVP - minimum viable product

* A **git repository (or repositories) hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often
* At **least** one Github commit per day
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public
* Have a **link to your hosted working app** in the `README.md` file in  each of your Github repos
* Due to the open-ended nature of this final project, each project will have their own additional MVPs that are agreed upon by the instructional team
* Demonstrate that you can **teach yourself something new**, use a technology that you haven't used in class _NOR_ on a previous project
    <details><summary>Expand for a non-exhaustive list of examples:</summary>

        - 3rd party api
        - CSS - new framework
        - CSS - no framework but use CSS-grid

        - React - integrate React Router
        - React UI library: Material-UI, React BootStrap etc.
        - React Enzyme testing library
        - React - use axios instead of fetch
        - Node/Express - use a new npm package

        New Stack:
        - Rails - use Angular 1.6 for front end
        - MERN stack : MongoDB, Express, React, Node
        - NERDS stack: Node, Express, React, Database SQL
        - PHP/Laravel
        - Python/Django

        Module Bundlers:
        - Webpack - non-rails app
        - Webpacker - for rails app with react
        - Gulp

        Other Front Ends:
        - React Native
        - Ionic
        - Vue
        - Angular 5.0

        Authorization:
        - Authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

        Other Hosting:
        - Host on Digital Ocean
        - Host on AWS

        - Other Libraries:
        - Lodash
        - Google Maps
        - Moment.js
        - jQuery UI
        - Chart.js
        - D3

        Other Databases
        - Firebase
        - Redis
    </details>

ALSO, remember: a **technical demonstration** of your app which:

* Is ~5-10 minutes in length (use 1-3 minutes to show off your portfolio then switch over and talk about your app)
* Shows off the features of the app (be sure to talk about the new thing you taught yourself)
* Explains the technical details
* Explains the technical challenges
* Explains which improvements you might make in the future

## Project due date is April 10th @ 10am ET


## Meetings with instructors
_Your instructor will contact you to setup a meeting time if you request to.  
**Project ideas must be approved by the end of the day March 17th**_

**What you must submit to instructor before March 17th:**

- Decide which new technology you will be teaching yourself and do a little research on it
- Create a new Github repo(or repos) on your personal github.com account, outside of the class repository (also, remember to make a `.gitignore` file, as needed)
- Start to Create your user stories and add them to your README.md
- Write what features will meet MVP and then list out other features as stretch goals
- Make wireframes and add them to your README.md (or put images and add links)

  ## Suggested Ways to Get Started

  <details><summary>List of ways to get started</summary>

  * **Wireframe** Make a drawing of what your app will look like on each page of your application (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like once a user logs in, etc.).

  <br>

  * **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.

  <br>

  * Create your **user stories**

  <br>

  * **Create a Trello board** and break down the user stories into cards

  <br>

  * **Work through / review the lessons and markdowns from class** for help and inspiration!

  <br>

  * **Create a schedule** Think about adding relevant code to your application each day.

  <br>

  * **Commit early, commit often.** If you break something, you can always go back in time to a previous version. We will be looking at your commit dates. Commits and comments are part of your scoring.

  <br>

  * **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into and the new technology you'll be teaching yourself.

  <br>

  * **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

## Where to go for help during project week

1. Seek out help online
2. Seek out help with your classmates
3. Seek out help with our class TA
4. Seek out help with your instructor


In just a few weeks time you'll be on your own. Debugging is a very important skill to have and practice. Getting help from an instructor should no longer be your first or second course of action. If you get really stuck and do need to consult an instructor, be prepared to explain the problem and what you've done to try to solve it. We recommend checking out the rubric here: [How to Ask for Help](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIR-Arete/wiki/How-To-Ask-A-Question)

## Reminders / Recommendations:

- Commit early, commit often! If something breaks, you can always revert to a previous commit.
- Create a Dev branch - Your Master branch should only ever contain working, deployable code.
- Use git branching for features, especially if you're trying something new or "going down a rabbit hole". Only merge to Dev when your code is working. Only merge Dev to Master when your code is production ready.
- Reflect on where you are each day (comfort zone, learning zone, panic zone). Maybe keep a dev journal.
- &hearts; BREATHE &hearts; SLEEP &hearts; EAT &hearts; CODE &hearts;
