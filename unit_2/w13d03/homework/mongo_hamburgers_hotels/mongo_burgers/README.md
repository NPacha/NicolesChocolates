# Beauty and the Burger

You want to help your friend create an app for their burger shop, where customers can order their burgers online either have them picked up or delivered. Your friend is a culinary visionary and envisions that burgers can be made with any meat (beef, chicken, turkey, ostrich, tofu, emu, buffalo, elk, etc...), cheese is optional (only 1 slice of American cheese allowed) and the burger can have any number of toppings ( ketchup, mustard, guacamole, Worstershire sauce, french fries, hot fudge, mayonnaise, pickled beets, mango, sriracha, onions, ramen, pickles, capers, relish, fried banana and with peanut butter, olives, tabasco, kimchi, maple syrup, mushrooms, fried green tomatoes, etc.).

The orders should have a

- meat selection
- whether or not there will be cheese
- a list of toppings
