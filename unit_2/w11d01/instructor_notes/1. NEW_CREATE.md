## Creating Restful Routes
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/Xj8SSfq.png' width="600">

## Creating new data
In the apps that we are creating and many apps that you use, you are oftening creating new data and adding it to a database. Take for example creating a Tweet or creating a user account on Twitter. This would be a great example of the necessity for creating data.

:thought_balloon: **Take a moment to think of one real world example where you might be creating new data**

## Visualize what we are doing
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4dBQiqZ.png" width="800">

## Create a new route and page

1. Let's create a page that will allow us to create a new fruit
1. First, we'll need a route for displaying the page in our server.js file **IMPORTANT: put this above your show route, so that the show route doesn't accidentally pick up a /fruits/new request**

    ```javascript
    //put this above your Show route
    app.get('/fruits/new', (req, res) => {
        res.render('New');
    });
    ```

1. Now lets's create the html for this page in our /views/New.jsx file

    ```jsx
    const React = require('react');

    class New extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <div>New Page</div>;
      }
    }

    module.exports = New;
    ```

1. Visit http://localhost:3000/fruits/new to see if it works

## Add interactivity to your site with forms

We can use forms to allow the user to enter their own data:
 ```jsx
    const React = require('react');

    class New extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>New Fruit page</h1>
                {/* NOTE: action will be the route, method will be the HTTP verb */}
                <form action="/fruits" method="POST">
                  Name: <input type="text" name="name" /><br/>
                  Color: <input type="text" name="color" /><br/>
                  Is Ready To Eat: <input type="checkbox" name="readyToEat" /><br/>
                  <input type="submit" name="" value="Create Fruit"/>
                </form>
            </div>);
        }
      }

    module.exports = New;
```

**NOTE: the form element has an action and a method attribute.  We get these values from our RESTful routes table.  We'll need this info for the next step too.**

## Create a post route

Since the form in the last step tells the browser to create a POST request to /fruits, we'll need to set up a route handler for this kind of request

```javascript
app.post('/fruits', (req, res) => {
    res.send('hi');
)};
```

## Define middleware

We can have a function execute for all routes:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('I run for all routes');
    next();
});
```

- This is called 'middleware'
- It runs in the middle of the request response cycle (in the middle)
    - sometime after the request is received, but before the final route handler is called
- Be sure to put middleware at the top of your server.js file, so that other routes don't handle the request and send the response before the middleware can be executed
- Most of the time, you won't write your own middleware, but a lot of plugins and extended functionality of express exist as middleware

## View body of a post request

1. The POST request to our sever has data in it (name, color, readyToEat, etc).
1. We can easily access this data with a middleware function
1. Tell express to use the middleware

    ```javascript
    //near the top, around other app.use() calls
    app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:false}));
    ```
Parses incoming requests with urlencoded payloads and is based on body-parser.

**What does [urlencoded do](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#express.urlencoded)**

1. Now inside the POST to /fruits route handler we can do the following:

    ```javascript
    app.post('/fruits', (req, res)=>{
        console.log(req.body);
        res.send('data received');
    });
    ```

1. Push this data into our fruits array:

    ```javascript
    app.post('/fruits', (req, res)=>{
        if(req.body.readyToEat === 'on'){ //if checked, req.body.readyToEat is set to 'on'
            req.body.readyToEat = true; //do some data correction
        } else { //if not checked, req.body.readyToEat is undefined
            req.body.readyToEat = false; //do some data correction
        }
        fruits.push(req.body);
        console.log(fruits);
        res.send('data received');
    });
    ```

## Redirect the user to another page

- The data has been added to our fruits array
- Let's send the user back to the fruits index page upon completion

```javascript
app.post('/fruits', (req, res)=>{
    if(req.body.readyToEat === 'on'){ //if checked, req.body.readyToEat is set to 'on'
        req.body.readyToEat = true;
    } else { //if not checked, req.body.readyToEat is undefined
        req.body.readyToEat = false;
    }
    fruits.push(req.body);
    res.redirect('/fruits'); //send the user back to /fruits
});
```

Put a link in the index page going to the new page

```html
<nav>
    <a href="/fruits/new">Create a New Fruit</a>
</nav>
```

###  Test Post Route with Postman
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/516/1*MP7BSXKJrQzCz_aI2zJr-g.png" width="300px" >

- Open up a new tab in postman
- Set your type of request
- Set the correct request url
- Add content to the Body tab
- Make sure you are using x-www-form-urlencoded
