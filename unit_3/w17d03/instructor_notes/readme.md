### Rendering Dynamic Routes

<details><summary>View Rendering Dyanmic Routes</summary>
We were able to get our basic routing structure down! Go us! Now we want to make dynamic routes. What are dynamic routes?

Think about a blog. With a blog a user should be able to create a blog post and the blog post will be able to be accessed from a unique URL. In our application, we need to mirror this concept by allowing dynamic routes to be created.

Can you think of how we might do this?

If you said `.map()` then you are correct! Letâ€™s take for instance the mock data below:

```js

let mockBlog = [
    {
        title: 'First Blog Post',
        description: 'My first blog post!'
    },
    {
        title: 'Second Blog Post',
        description: 'My Second blog post!'
    },
    {
        title: 'Third Blog Post',
        description: 'My Third blog post!'
    }
];

```

If we wanted to turn this data into routes and dynamically display each blog posts data, we could map over the array and render Routes!

Then we could pass each newly rendered component a prop with the content for the blog post! We will need to create a new component for the blog posts. We could title it `BlogPost`.

Finally, we would have to use map again to create the navigational links!


```js
{state.data.map((post,index) => {
    return <Route path={`/${post.title}`} component={() => <BlogPost content={post} />} />
})}
```
