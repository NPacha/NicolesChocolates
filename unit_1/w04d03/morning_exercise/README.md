# Landscaper

![studio ghibli landscape](https://peakmemory.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/cliufqx.jpg)

You'll be creating a simple, browser-based JavaScript game that utilizes `alert()` and `prompt()` to send messages and receive input from the user.

#### Learning Objectives

- Putting everything you've learned so far together (arrays, loops, conditionals)

#### Prerequisites

- JavaScript (arrays, loops, conditionals)

---

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to today's morning_exercise folder and then into the landscaper folder. There you will find an `index.html` and an `app.js`. They should already be connected. Double check by opening your `index.html` in the browser and looking for a `console.log`. 

1. **Before you get started writing any code, examine the starter code** you've been provided with so you know what you're working with and what you'll need to do. You may have to jump around in the code instead of working top to bottom.

## Landscaper

1. You are starting a landscaping business, but all you have are your teeth.
1. Using just your teeth, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $1.  You can do this as much as you want.

1. At any point, if you are currently using your teeth, you can buy a pair of rusty scissors for $5.  You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

1. Using the rusty scissors, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $5.  You can do this as much as you want.

1. At any point, if you are currently using rusty scissors, you can buy an old-timey push lawnmower for $25.  You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

1. Using the old-timey push lawnmower, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $50.  You can do this as much as you want.

1. At any point, if you are currently using the old-timey push lawnmower, you can buy a fancy battery-powered lawnmower for $250.  You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

1. Using the the fancy battery-powered lawnmower, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $100.  You can do this as much as you want.

1. At any point, if you are currently using the fancy battery-powered lawnmower, you can hire a team of starving students for $500.  You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

1. Using the the team of starving students, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $250.  You can do this as much as you want.

1. You win the game when you have a team of starving students and $1000.  In this situation, send a message to the user telling them, they've won.


## Deliverables

Your submission should include an `index.html` and `app.js` that simulates the landscaper game outlined above. Your app must have:

- The ability to take user input
- The ability for the user to earn money
- The ability to buy tools and use the new tool
- The ability to win the game and end it
    - _Hint:_ Try setting the win amount to $10 frst, then $50, and etc. until you get to the end to allow for easier testing!

## Technical Requirements
1. Your landscaper game *must* run on first load with no syntax errors
1. If there are errors you can't solve, comment them out and leave a comment above it explaining what is wrong

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit your work via github issues, just like you would for Homework and remember to fill out the form! The submission title should be **Your Name - w02d01 - Landscaper** (yes, please use w02d01 - this will help us with grading)
**and it should link to today's morning exercise folder (w02d04 > morning_exercise)**

## Hungry for More?

1. Add the ability to reset the game at any point so that you can play again
1. Make it so that a user can have multiple tools, and money earned each day is increased appropriately (e.g. 2 scissors, and an old-timey push lawnmower means you earn $60/day )
1. Once you've implemented multiple tools, make it so you can sell tools for half price

#### Super duper hungry more?: Landscaper Inspiration

1. Try making your game playable via the DOM via buttons or input forms as opposed to using the console and alerts and prompts!

1. Some of our students went above and beyond for this homework doing exactly that! See below for some examples:
