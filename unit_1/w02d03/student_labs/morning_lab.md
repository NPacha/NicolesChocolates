## Problem solving

Remember:

* one step at a time (test thoroughly each step)
* researching a step is excellent (although time-consuming)

# 1
## Calculate the Cube
Write a function `calculateCube` that takes a single number and prints the volume of a cube made from that number.

```javascript
console.log(calculateCube(5));
```

> => 125


# 2
## Is a Vowel?
Write a function `isAVowel` that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise. The vowel could be upper or lower case.

```javascript
console.log(isAVowel("a"));
```

> => true


# 3
## Get Two Lengths
Write a function `getTwoLengths` that accepts two parameters (strings). The function should return an _array_ of numbers where each number is the length of the corresponding string.

```javascript
console.log(getTwoLengths("Hank", "Hippopopalous"));
```

> => [4, 13]


# 4 
## Get Multiple Lengths

Write a function `getMultipleLengths` that accepts a single parameter as an argument: an **array of strings**. The function should return an array of **numbers** where each number is the length of the corresponding string.


```javascript
console.log(getMultipleLengths(["hello", "what", "is", "up", "dude"]));
```

> => [5, 4, 2, 2, 4]
