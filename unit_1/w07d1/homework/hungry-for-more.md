# DOM Interaction Labs
Get some more practice with the DOM and interactivity by coming up with solutions for the following interactions. 

It is your job to look at the mockup or prototype and create the appropriate HTML, CSS and JavaScript to replicate the interaction. Feel free to use jQuery!

**You will need to create a new folder for each interaction. You will have to create the html file, css file and js file for each lab on your own.**

Start with psuedocode and then begin to write your actual code!

Have fun!
